# Hyper-converged GlusterFS and Heketi Dynamic Volume Provisioning on Google Container Engine (GKE)

Original project is DEAD.

The updates provide current working scripts tested on Kubernetes 1.17, and also replace the scaling out with multi zone support, as it was originally creating all resources in a single zone.

## Open Items To Fix

The script 'scripts/job/02-set-kernel-modules.sh' needs to be converted to DaemonSet instead of running commands directly on the kubernetes nodes. This will not survive upgrades, reconfiguring, or new nodes.

## Usage

1. Edit [config](config) to match your GKE project/zone
2. Source [helpers](helpers)
3. Generate `k8s` (run `gke_glusterfs_heketi_generate_k8s`)
4. Build docker image (run `gke_glusterfs_heketi_build_image`)
5. Push docker image (run `gke_glusterfs_heketi_push_image`)
6. Create a cluster (run `gke_glusterfs_heketi_create_cluster` if you want)
7. Configure cluster permissions (RBAC) (run `gke_glusterfs_heketi_configure_rbac`)
8. Deploy `Job` within the cluster (run `gke_glusterfs_heketi_deploy_glusterfs_heketi`)
9. Wait for it to finish (tail the logs if you want with: `gke_glusterfs_heketi_tail_job_logs`) **NOTE:** This takes forever. The script that runs `gk-deploy -g` to deploy glusterfs runs a job and the script has to wait for the job to time out right now before proceeding to create the necessary firewall rules and storage class.

### Testing it worked

You can deploy the example k8s (mariadb statefulset) to test that everything works.

1. `kubectl apply -f k8s-example`

If the `mariadb` pod gets stuck in "pending", you may need to recreate the storage class (I'm not sure why this is a bug).

This can be taken care of with `gke_glusterfs_heketi_if_storage_class_not_found_during_k8s_example_run_me`

### Tear down / Clean up

1. Run `gke_glusterfs_heketi_delete_cluster_and_disks`

## Installation flow

**NOTE:** All of this is automated. This is included purely for documentation purposes.

1. Create a cluster with at least 3 nodes
2. Create persistent disks and attach to the nodes
3. Load necessary kernel modules for GlusterFS, install `glusterfs-client` on host machines
4. Generate storage network topology
5. Create necessary firewall rules
6. Run `gk-deploy -g` to deploy the glusterfs daemonset and heketi
7. Change heketi service from `ClusterIP` to `NodePort` (will i/o timeout otherwise during persistent volume claim)
8. Update firewall rules to allow new heketi node port
9. Deploy heketi/glusterfs storage class using `<any node ip>:<heketi nodeport>`
